cool to have besides just be an irc client:

- slack emojis/custom emojis
- different colors for different users
- notifications on mentions/pings
- games between two users (like it creates a seperate channel as a little pipe for the game and data is transmitted as messages, tic tac toe, hangman, etc)
- see multiple channels at once
- when disconnecting, have a server store messages for you and deliver them when you reconnect (though this would require a server)
